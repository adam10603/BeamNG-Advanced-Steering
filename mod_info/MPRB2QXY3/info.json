    "message": "[B][I]\nThis is a complete overhaul of BeamNG's steering input system for controller and keyboard players.[\/I][\/B]\n\n[CENTER][ATTACH]995345[\/ATTACH] [\/CENTER]\n\nArcade Steering aims to give vehicles a more intuitive steering feel that makes driving more predictable and fun. It's suited for all kinds of driving including track racing, rallying, drifting etc.\n\nThe main features include:\n[LIST]\n[*]Accurate steering limit to utilize the steered wheels' peak grip\n[LIST]\n[*]This is similar to the [I]Understeer reduction assistant[\/I] in 0.26+\n[\/LIST]\n[*]Natural countersteer tendency, simulating the effects of the car's caster angle\n[LIST]\n[*]This is similar to the [I]Oversteer reduction assistant[\/I] in 0.26+\n[\/LIST]\n[*]More refined steering feel compared to the stock assists\n[*]Highly customizable settings\n[\/LIST]\nDespite the \"arcade\" name this isn't an unrealistic or artificial driver-aid. The mod mostly mimics how the steering behaves on real cars, and makes controller and keyboard driving more on par with using a force-feedback steering wheel.\n\nThe mod includes a UI app called [I]Arcade Steering Settings[\/I] which lets you fine tune the steering feel to your liking, although the default settings should be fine for most people.\n\n[CENTER][ATTACH]995346[\/ATTACH] [\/CENTER]\n\nFor more info you can visit the project's [URL='https:\/\/github.com\/adam10603\/BeamNG-Arcade-Steering'][B][U]Github page[\/U][\/B][\/URL] which also has a [URL='https:\/\/github.com\/adam10603\/BeamNG-Arcade-Steering\/blob\/main\/ConfigGuide.md'][B][U]configuration guide[\/U][\/B][\/URL] explaining all the settings, or you can visit the mod's [URL='https:\/\/www.beamng.com\/threads\/arcade-steering-mod.85494\/'][B][U]forum thread[\/U][\/B][\/URL] for discussions.\n\nHave fun!",
