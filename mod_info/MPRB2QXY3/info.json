It's suited for all kinds of driving including track racing, rallying, drifting etc. and it's recommended to anyone on keyboard or controller regardless of skill level.\n\nThe main features include:\n[LIST]\n[*]Accurate steering limit to utilize the steered wheels' peak grip\n[LIST]\n[*]This is similar to the [I]Understeer reduction assistant[\/I] in 0.26+\n[\/LIST]\n[*]Natural self-steer tendency, simulating the effects of the car's caster angle\n[LIST]\n[*]This is similar to the [I]Oversteer reduction assistant[\/I] in 0.26+\n[\/LIST]\n[*]More refined steering feel compared to the stock input system\n[*]Highly customizable settings\n[\/LIST]\nThe principles implemented by this mod are a common way of processing steering input in racing games (both arcade and sim), and they mimic real-life driving mechanics. The goal is to make the steering behave in a way that you otherwise wouldn't get if your input device lacks force-feedback.\n\nThe mod includes a UI app called [I]Advanced Steering Settings[\/I] which lets you fine tune the steering feel to your liking, although the default settings should be fine for most people.\n\n[CENTER][ATTACH]1010196[\/ATTACH] [\/CENTER]\n\nFor more info you can visit the project's [URL='https:\/\/github.com\/adam10603\/BeamNG-Advanced-Steering'][B][U]Github page[\/U][\/B][\/URL] which also has a [URL='https:\/\/github.com\/adam10603\/BeamNG-Advanced-Steering\/blob\/release\/ConfigGuide.md'][B][U]configuration guide[\/U][\/B][\/URL] explaining all the settings, or you can visit the mod's [URL='https:\/\/www.beamng.com\/threads\/advanced-steering-mod.85494\/'][B][U]forum thread[\/U][\/B][\/URL] for discussions.\n\nHave fun!",
