# Better Steering
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0-blue.svg)


## Intro üñäÔ∏è


This is an extensive modification of BeamNG.drive's steering input system for controller and keyboard. Unfortunately the default system is incredibly simplistic and falls short of the necessary level of input processing seen in other driving games, resulting in an unrealistically difficult and frustrating driving experience.

The idea to improve the game's steering system isn't new. [There have been discussions](https://www.beamng.com/threads/steering-assist-for-over-under-steerers.59477/) about it for a long time, as well as attempts to fix it such as the ["Forza" Steerig Mod](https://www.beamng.com/threads/forza-steering-for-keyboard-and-gamepad.77578/), or [IKT's script](https://gist.github.com/E66666666/207027cc29f1869a43f6ccef054e3845) that uses his GTA-style input processing logic.

After seeing that others are just as frustrated with BeamNG.drive's barbaric input handling as I was, I decided to fix it myself. The main features of this mod include:

 - Dynamic, slip angle-based steering limit
 - Ability to properly countersteer in a slide or drift
 - Forces acting on the steered wheels can feed back into the steering rack
 - Cars will naturally countersteer to an extent
 - Highly customizable config file

Despite what it might sound like, you shouldn't think of this mod as some kind of unfair driver-aid. This is simply the normal way in which driving games (both arcade and sim) handle player input, and it simulates behaviors that cars in real life would exhibit.

Here are two quick videos comparing the stock input system to the modified one:
