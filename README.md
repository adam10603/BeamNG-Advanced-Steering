# BeamNG.drive: Arcade Steering
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-2.0-blue.svg) ![Compatibility](https://img.shields.io/badge/Game_compatibility-v26.2.0-green.svg)


## Intro üñäÔ∏è


This is an extensive modification of BeamNG.drive's steering input system for controller and keyboard. It provides a steering system that's more aware of the vehicle's underlying physics and results in an improved steering feel.

Before the 0.26 game version, this mod added a very different approach to input processing compared to anything seen in the stock game. But with version 0.26 the developers added an ***Understeer reduction assistant*** and ***Oversteer reduction assistant*** setting, likely inspired by the first version of this mod. Those assists implement very similar concepts to this mod, and they are much better than the pre-0.26 situation. However, the default assists still aren't quite perfect IMO, so this mod now exists as a refinement of sorts.

The main features of the mod include:

 - Accurate steering limit to utilize the steered wheels' peak grip
   - This is similar to the ***Understeer reduction assistant*** in 0.26+
 - Natural countersteer tendency, simulating the effects of the car's caster angle
   - This is similar to the ***Oversteer reduction assistant*** in 0.26+
 - More refined steering feel compared to the stock assists
 - Highly customizable settings

Despite what it might sound like, you shouldn't think of this as some kind of artificial driver-aid. This is a common way of processing steering input in racing games (both arcade and sim), and it mimics real-life driving mechanics as well as behaviors you'll get when using a steering wheel with force-feedback.


## Installation üñ•Ô∏è


 1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/adam10603/BeamNG-Arcade-Steering/releases) (click the ***Source code (zip)*** option).
 2. Copy the zip file to your `mods` folder ([follow this guide](https://documentation.beamng.com/tutorials/mods/installing-mods/#manual-installation) if you don't know where it is).
 3. The mod should now appear in the in-game mod manager.


## Setup üõ†


Go to ***Options*** ‚û° ***Controls*** ‚û° ***Bindings*** ‚û° ***Vehicle***, and click on the bind(s) for steering. Make sure that the ***Filter*** is set correctly (or use ***Automatic*** if unsure), and set the ***1:1 steering angle*** to 0 if you're using a controller.

The mod will not do anything with the ***Wheel (direct)*** filter, as it's only meant for keyboard and controller. But for steering input specifically, it does modify the behavior of the other filter types.

The ***Key (smooth)*** filter will lower the [Steering speed](ConfigGuide.md#steering-speed) and [Input authority](ConfigGuide.md#input-authority) settings to 60% of their original value when you drive. This gives a smoother feel that's easier to control on keyboard. The ***Key (fast)*** and ***Gamepad*** filters are identical, and both use the config values as-is.

Any steering-related option in the game such as ***Understeer reduction assistant***, ***Oversteer reduction assistant***, ***Slower steering at high speed*** or ***Limit steering at high speed*** will not work as long as you're driving with this mod enabled. This is because the mod completely bypasses the default steering system and uses its own logic for everything.

## Usage üéÆ


When you first spawn a vehicle, an automatic steering calibration takes place. You won't be able to drive until it's over, but it only lasts about 1 second.

That's pretty much it. Keep driving and you should notice a change in steering feel, and that cars feel more well-behaved and predictable. Things like drifting will also feel different.


## [Config Guide üìù](ConfigGuide.md)


The default settings will work just fine for most people, but you can use the included UI app to tweak the settings to your taste.

Go to ***UI Apps*** in the top menu in-game, click ***Add app*** and look for ***Arcade Steering Config***. This widget will let you tweak the settings on the fly.

Click the link above for a full breakdown of each setting in the app.
