# BeamNG.drive: Better Steering
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0-blue.svg) ![Compatibility](https://img.shields.io/badge/BeamNG.drive_compatibility-v24.1.2-green.svg)


## Intro üñäÔ∏è


This is an extensive modification of BeamNG.drive's steering input system for controller and keyboard. Unfortunately the default system is very simplistic and falls short of the necessary level of input processing seen in other driving games, resulting in an unrealistically difficult and frustrating driving experience.

The idea to improve the game's steering system isn't new. [There have been discussions](https://www.beamng.com/threads/steering-assist-for-over-under-steerers.59477/) about it for a long time, as well as attempts to fix it such as the ["Forza" Steerig Mod](https://www.beamng.com/threads/forza-steering-for-keyboard-and-gamepad.77578/), or [IKT's script](https://gist.github.com/E66666666/207027cc29f1869a43f6ccef054e3845) that uses his GTA-style steering logic.

After seeing that others are just as frustrated with BeamNG.drive's barbaric input handling as I was, I decided to make a more polished and well-rounded mod to fix it. The main features of this mod include:

 - Dynamic, slip angle-based steering limit
 - Ability to properly countersteer in a slide or drift
 - Forces acting on the steered wheels can feed back into the steering rack
 - Cars will naturally countersteer to an extent, simulating the effect of their caster angle
 - Highly customizable config file

Despite what it might sound like, you shouldn't think of this mod as some kind of artificial driver-aid. This is simply the normal way in which driving games (both arcade and sim) handle player input, and it simulates behaviors that cars in real life would exhibit.

BeamNG.drive not having these by default is a huge detriment to the playability and feel of the game. Proper input processing like this drastically improves how cars feel to drive. At some point I might add a more detailed page explaining this further.

Here are two quick videos comparing the stock input system to the modified one:

## Installation üñ•Ô∏è


 1. Navigate to the game's main directory, then go to `lua\vehicle`.
 2. Rename `input.lua` to something else. This serves as a backup of the original file, in case you want to restore it.
 3. Copy `input.lua` and `better_steering_config.json` from the mod's files to the `vehicle` directory.

Since this mod replaces game files instead of using the game's modding API, updating the game may remove the modded files.


## Setup üõ†


Go to ***Options*** ‚û° ***Controls*** ‚û° ***Bindings*** ‚û° ***Vehicle***, and click on the bind for ***Steering***. Make sure that the steering lock type is ***1:N***, and that the filter type matches the input device of the bind.

The mod will not work with the ***Wheel (direct)*** filter (as it's only meant for keyboard and controller), but it does modify the behavior of the other filter types (for steering specifically).

The ***Key (smooth)*** filter will lower the `steeringSpeed` and `inputAuthority` settings internally. The ***Key (fast)*** and ***Gamepad*** filters are identical, and both use the config values as-is.

Note that the ***Limit steering at speed*** option on the ***Filters*** tab will be ignored when the mod is active, as the mod uses its own logic to limit steering.


## Config Guide üìù


The default values in the config file work just fine, but if you want to customize the experience, refer to the full guide above.

If you make changes to the config file, just press `Ctrl+R` in-game to reload your current vehicle. The changes will apply right away without restarting the game.


## Usage üéÆ


When you first spawn a vehicle, an automatic steering calibration takes place. You won't be able to control the vehicle until it's over, but it only lasts about 1 second, so don't worry.

If you use a controller, don't be afraid to give 100% stick input to turn. You won't be grinding down the front tires like before, since the mod will ensure that the steering angle is appropriate.

There's not much else to it. You should notice that it's easier to get a feel for what your car is doing, and cars should feel more well-behaved and predictable.
